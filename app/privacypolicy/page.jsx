        Like most website operators, I collect non-personal information of the
        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
        browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
        of each visitor request.

      <p className='text-center text-black'>
        A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
        computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each
        time the visitor returns. My website uses cookies to help identify and
        track visitors, their usage of the website, and their website access
        preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
        computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the
